# sdp
Ideas I am trying about the semidefinite programming.

I aim to find a (space or time) efficient algorithm for solving SDP encountered in the research of higher-order quantum transformations (transformation of (mostly) black-box quantum operations, \`\`higher\'\' in the sense that this is the transformation of unknown \`\`transformation of the quantum state\'\').

My algorithm does not require storing all matrices specifying constraints as long as the projector onto the subspace spanned by these matrices is possible.
