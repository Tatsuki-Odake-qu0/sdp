# sdp
Ideas I am trying about the semidefinite programming.

My aim is to find an efficient algorithm for solving SDP encountered in the research of higher-order quantum transformations (transformation of (mostly) black-box quantum operations, \`\`higher\'\' in the sense that this is transformation of unknown \`\`transformation of quantum state\'\').
